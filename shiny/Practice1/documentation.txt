*****Server File:

***Internal Variables

*file_data -> a reactive function that, when called, reads the data from a given csv
    file. 
*numerics -> a reactive function that, when called, results in a vector of numeric
    data colums in file_data().
*plt -> a reactive function that, when called, returns a ggplot statement designed 
    for a desired plot with user input parameters.
*plotWinTit -> an event-reactive function that, when called, returns the title for the
    plotting part of the page. Activates when "Proceed to plot" button is clicked.
*plotWin -> an event-reactive function with same trigger as plotWinTit which returns 
    the UI for the parameter selection and plot windows.
    
***Output list of variables

*dataHead -> returns the head of data table read from the csv file. requires the
    input of a valid file.

*plotType -> UI for selection of plot type. 
*x -> a UI for scrolldown menu for valid columns that can be used as abscissa based
    on the plot type.
*y -> same as above for Ordinate.

note: the above 3 UI elements were written here instead of in UI file because 
    1) modularity so as to not clutter up the plot window UI to the extent possible
    2) x and y contain conditional elements dependent on input variables and which will decide the options available for them. If we were to use conditional Panel,
it would require multiple such panels...

*plotWindowTitle -> UI of title of the plot window. This is based on           plotWinTit and hence is reactive
*plotWindow -> UI of the plot window. 
note: again, plot window UI is here instead of the UI file because of the requirement of event reactivity.
